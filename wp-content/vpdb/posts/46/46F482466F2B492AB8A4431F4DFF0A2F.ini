post_content = "As I walked in the office, I was nervous and maybe even scared. Today would be the day that I get braces put on! I worried about how painful it would be based on the horror stories my friends shared with me. I also wondered how long I would have to wear them. Dr. Hart greeted me with a huge smile on his face. He seemed very nice and kind. I sat in the chair and Dr. Hart began the process of perfectly placing each bracket on each tooth. He handed me a mirror so I could see my teeth. Through all the appointments and adjustments with new wires and new colors, Dr. Hart was very efficient, encouraging, and helpful. I was able to get my braces off in half the normal time because I never broke a bracket during my treatment and followed his instructions. I am truly impressed with the results and I simply LOVE my smile. Thank you for being my orthodontist!"
