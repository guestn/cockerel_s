post_content = "Dr. Hart started working with my daughter when she was 13 and too embarrassed to even smile because of her teeth. He quickly came up with a plan to straighten her teeth. He involved me and my daughter in her treatment plan and explained every step along the way. He recommended different options but ultimately left it up to my family to decide which way we wanted to go. Dr. Hart was always courteous, punctual and competent. Almost one year later, the braces are off and my daughter’s teeth look incredible. She smiles again and I couldn’t be happier to see her more confident than she was when she first came in for treatment. I recommend Dr. Hart with the utmost praise to anyone in need of orthodontic care. My daughter and I couldn’t be more grateful at how he transformed her teeth and the care he took."
