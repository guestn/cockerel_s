post_content = "My family and I have been so happy with Dr. Hart! Our 9 year old son William was scared about getting braces but he said Dr. Hart was “a cool dude” and “super nice”. He made the whole process fun, easy, and interesting for our son. Dr. Hart was careful to explain things really well and always had a word for sister, too. William was always very happy after meeting with Dr. Hart and honestly looked forward to their visits, which a lot of kids probably can’t say."
